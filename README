RmanPtcSop
==========
The RmanPtcSop project is a Houdini geometry operator (SOP) for loading and 
displaying RenderMan point clouds. It is based on the open source 
dnPtcViewerNode project from Double Negative Visual Effects.

Features of the rmanPtc SOP include:
* Independent control for limiting the number of points loaded and displayed.
* Geometry output for all point attributes in the cloud.
* OpenGL display preview for attributes as point or disk primitives.
* Ability to cull points based on a reference bounding box.

The code is freely available from http://github.com/danbethell/rmanptcsop and 
is released under the New BSD license. See the COPYING file for more details.
